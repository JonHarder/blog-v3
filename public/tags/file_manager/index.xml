    <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Vifm is the vi file manager. It uses dual window design reminiscient of midnight
commander, but attempts to replicate vi keybindings as much as possible.</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>NOTE: I have installed the catppuccin theme and the
<a href="https://github.com/thimc/vifm_devicons" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">vim devicons</a> plugin.</em></p>
<p>The emulation is so complete that I can confidently say, if you know how to use
vi (or vim or neovim) you already know how to use vifm. Your intuition as to
moving around, copying and pasting files, using marks, etc will guide you to the
correct key or command.</p>]]></description>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a quick screenshot of mc in action.</p>

<p>Eww. How very&hellip;MS Dos (or maybe this is nostalgic for you. To each their own).
This is intentional; as it started life as a clone of the popular
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norton_Commander" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Norton Commander</a>. It was first
released in 1994 (8 years after its predecessor) and replicated the dual window
text user interface almost exactly.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://ranger.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Ranger</a> is a &ldquo;console file manager with VI key
bindings.&rdquo; Specifically it is a terminal file manager. You&rsquo;re most likely
familiar with GUI file managers in the form of mac's finder, or the directrory
viewer built into your editor of choice.</p>
<p>Terminal file managers live in a unique space as they tend to focus on keyboard
based workflows over click-and-drag mouse-based workflows. How can you get
anything done as a file manager using just your keyboard? If you&rsquo;re in the
terminal, why not just use good ol' <code>cd</code>, <code>mv</code>, <code>cp</code>, <code>rm</code> and friends?</p>]]></description>
