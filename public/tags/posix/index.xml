    <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>Bash is a (perhaps <em>the</em> ubiquitous) shell. As a member of the POSIX
interface, bash provides a consistent access point to applications on
your operating system.</p>
<p>Because it is all but guaranteed to be installed on any server and
environment, learning this one interface will ensure you can be
comfortable interacting with any computer.</p>
<p>Before we begin, it will be helpful to clear up a few ambiguous terms
related to command line tools that often come up together. A <em>terminal</em>
is a desktop application you start which presents you with a <em>command
line</em> interface, running your chosen <em>shell</em>.</p>]]></description>

<p><a href="/posts/sed" rel="">last</a> time we discussed the command line utility, <code>sed</code>. as a
stream editor, <code>sed</code> provides a programmatic way to edit files or streams of
data. rather than opening up a full-fledged, interactive text editor or ide you
can reach for <code>sed</code>.</p>
<p>this is particularily useful when you need to make repetative edits over many
lines, or only on particular lines. <code>sed</code> is also useful for general purpose use
cases when viewing parts of files or trimming and cleaning up data.</p>]]></description>

<p><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/sed.1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Sed</a> stands for (s)tream
(ed)itor and is useful for taking any input you have and modifying it in some
way before sending it along as output, either to the console or as input to the
next command in your pipeline. It operates on each line of your input, executing
some command on each as the input is read.</p>
<p>Chances are if you&rsquo;ve encountered <code>sed</code> before, it came from some sage linux
master on stack overflow when providing an answer to a bash scripting question.
If you&rsquo;ve used <code>sed</code> yourself for some task, it&rsquo;s likely using the <code>substitute</code>
command to find and replace some search term.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/find.1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Find</a> is a utility to <em>find</em>
files on your computer given a wide range of search parameters. It will
recursively walk your filesystem
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">breadth-first</a>) and print
(by default) all filenames that have matched your search terms. Think of it like
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/grep.1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">grep</a> but for file names
rather than file contents.</p>
<p>You can search on a variety of metadata on files, ranging from name, creation
time, update time, owner, group, size, and type (file, directory, link, socket,
etc.).</p>]]></description>

    <title>Grep</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Grep is a fundamental part of the command line toolbelt. True to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Unix philosophy</a>, grep does one
thing, and does it well. Its job is to search input for a given search pattern
and print all lines that match. Think of it like <code>Command-f</code> for the
terminal.</p>
<p>Its origins date back to the <code>ed</code> text editor. It was a common practice within
<code>ed</code> to execute the command <code>g/r(egular) e(expression)/p</code>, meaning,
<code>globally</code> search for lines that match the given <code>regular expression</code> and
<code>print</code> them. This functionality was so useful, that the name &quot;grep&quot; became
synonomous with the act of searching files and printing matches, and a
standalone <code>grep</code> program was born.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>]]></description>
