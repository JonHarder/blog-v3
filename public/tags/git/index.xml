    <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The <a href="/posts/git_commit" rel="">last post</a> in our series on git discussed the structure
and importance of git commits. Ideally, every commit you make would be clear,
concise, small, logical, and self-contained. Unfortunately, reality rarely
allows us to know ahead of time what exactly will end up becoming a perfect
commit. You may commit the first step in your feature, and come to realize while
you are working on the next step that your first commit is not quite right. Or
maybe you notice a simple typo in the work you just committed.</p>]]></description>

    <title>What Makes a Good Git Commit</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>I want to kick off this series of articles on git with the humble commit.
Commits are the basic unit of change in your codebase. Like an atom, you cannot
break things down any further than a commit<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Git automatically keeps track
of which files were changed, who changed them, and when. It is up to YOU,
however, to decide what information is added to that commit to give context to
others or your future self about the changes.</p>]]></description>
